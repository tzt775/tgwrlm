20:25 NOT THE BODY PILLOWS LMAOOO also i love how they're not going with the stereotypes of horny teen boy and shy smart girl so far
23:30 joey really is carrying (and i love it)
25:08 so relatable
28:55 it's so uncanny to me how wills side profile looks so similar to jeffs
30:33 LMAOO i so didn't see that one coming
30:43 same girl, same
33:08 i've never heard this song before but i already know it's gonna be a banger
34:50 dayum
36:05 it's so expressive i love it
36:20 told you this was gonna be a banger
37:16 this is funny out of context
37:43 is it just gonna be grace on a murder spree?
38:28 is this just gonna be a trope now-
39:20 omg i can't, jon just said ""wifu material"" which is something i never would've even dreamt of happening
40:12 noooo joey are you okayyy
43:08 please tell me this has become a meme
46:32 i will be quoting this on a daily basis
48:41 i love that line so much
48:51 IS THIS A TGWDLM REFERENCE??
53:11 surprisingly wholesome
55:09 aaand here we have the title, nice
56:44 lmaoo so true
57:47 holy shit this is uhh very concerning
58:12 isn't this the same sound as in TGWDLM w dan and donna? 
58:21 IT IS STILL DAN AND DONNA OMG
59:01 just a lil corey apprechiation moment
1:03:05 epic
1:04:27 LMAOO NOT CLIVESDALE AGAIN
1:05:27 omgg that's so cute i can't
1:06:12 that's some real bro bond right there
1:07:21 I knew it wouldn't fucking last, it never does with hatchetfield
1:07:57 YOOOOOOOOO
1:08:48 SMOKE CLUB REFERENCE LESGOOOO
1:09:00 the notes of ""run for their lives"" immediately reminded me of the NMT intros. Also incredible acting on jons part in this specific scene
1:11:22 NMT THEME MUSICCCCC
1:16:30 okay my guess is that the cops are actually talking about rickie (idk jons character) but the gang thinks they're talking about max
1:17:20 booooom i got it right
1:20:06 my man, after all the shows we already got on hatchetfield, i doubt that it ever was safe
1:20:58 ahghgh this makes me so happy
1:22:14 YOOO I LITERALLY SCREAMED ZIGGY IS BACK HOLY FUCK THIS IS WONDERFUL
1:22:23 THE MAN IN A HURRY WOHOOO
1:22:50 JAMES TOLBERT IS HERE TOO WTH THIS IS SO COOL
1:23:04 that is some awesome voice power my goodness
1:23:43 AAAAAAINT NO FUCKIN WAY IT'S GERALD JKJDSKJDSKJSDJKSD
1:26:29 this is so out of context, even in context i love it so much this is the kinda starkid stuff i missed in black friday
1:40:24 JAZZ HANDS INTROOO
1:40:43 AINT NO WAY, I DID NOT SEE THIS COMING JKSDJKJSDKJSDKJSD
1:41:18 i screamed just as loud as the audience THIS IS SO GOOD

2:11:25 okay okay hear me out, couldn't grace and max have their little lovey dovey story and steph and pete can both live and go to homecoming together? Like, that would be so nice and peaceful. Horny is more powerful than homicide lmao. I don't think they're gonna go w the peaceful, happy ending though, they never do that
2:24:40 damn, was i actually right?? aint no way HATCHETFIELD has a good ending... i can't believe it

Well damn, this was awesome! I expected the theme to be darker, like black friday and the nightmare time series, but to me it feels a bit more like some of the older shows starkid has produces, which i am also very happy about. The music was great, although not as diverse as other shows, but it didn't bother me at all. The sound quality was astounding. Acting was on point. This almost felt more like a movie than a musical, due to the impressive video quality, as well as the way it was edited. The vocal performance of everybody was incredible. I liked the choreo a lot as well. Very well done everyone! I really hope to see more in the future! <3",11,@fayflurina3382,False,False,False,0,Nerdy Prudes

Ugz0lLHNk-cApWMaqWZ4AaABAg,"I love the idea that the lords of the black calls Steph a ‚Äústupid silly girl‚Äù because she repeats her mistakes without thinking.

1. She invites Pete to Pasquale‚Äôs, everyone knows that‚Äôs the cool kid hang out spot. Max was definitely going to be there. No one thought about it and Pete got his ass beat.

2. The follow up was Steph wanted to go to an authority (the principal) but gets talked out of it.

3. She then gets tricked by Grace into getting into deeper shit.

Part 2.

1. She lures Max into the Wayland Mansion, a structurally unsound place, where they plan on scaring a confrontational destructive bully- he would‚Äôve only ever destroyed the house and someone would be getting hurt, or in this case dead.

2. The follow up was Steph wanting to go to the police yet she gets talked out of it.

3. She then makes a deal with the Lords in Black to kill her love interest.

The two acts are divided by Steph being pulled along by people and dealing with the consequences and yet somehow never learning her lesson.

The nerds knew the consequences and are easily peer pressured. Grace has an affinity for violence. Steph was the only person not victimised by social status originally and yet made these insane choices.  

By all means she‚Äôs not solely responsible for what happened but most of it could‚Äôve been avoided if she thought about where to invite Pete initially or  following her instincts about just going to the principal.",33,@kirarxse8893,False,False,False,0,Nerdy Prudes

UgwKaXA576fejSA5xmt4AaABAg,"So Grace ultimately becomes evil? I mean - my take on it is; she struggled to keep herself pure and then the events that play out as her one line said 'you think I'd stop with him' and 'put your hand there like all the guys that came before you' - makes me think she had this whole thing planned and she knew the history of the house. I mean - she can't exactly get her Chastity back after giving it to a ghost but maybe that's why she did it in the first place?

Big mistake on my part. The first episode is a little rough and has many issues but they're all fixed in later episodes. There are 2 seasons of Nightmare Time and season 2 is so much better quality than the first one. It's not done over zoom anymore and many actors play multiple characters at the same time though video editing. The costumes, props, editing etc are really good and for every story there is a high quality music video (with banger songs btw). Every story in Nightmare Time 2 is also happening in the same timeline. Yellowjacket is the last episode (it's about Lex, Ethan and Hannah fro Black Friday) and the first episode is Honey Queen (It's about Linda Monroe aka the rich blonde lady played by Lauren) and it's sooo good!

But, the good news is, that version of Starkid I love so much is being kept alive in Starkid's side projects, as well as some Tin Can Bros stuff, which I am so grateful for!

And, don't get me wrong, I still love this musical. I love the characters, the music has some of Jeff Blim's best songs yet and I honestly can't stop thinking about The Summoning scene!

Ugy8xx6bjpNokZ3cAal4AaABAg,"Thank you for this impressive piece of art! The music was fascinating, and the storyline actually really intriguing. Having the nerd not want to be around the 'cool' girl not because he doesn't think he's cool enough to deserve her, but because he knows that there are rules in place to punish him for it even though he doesn't deserve it. Having the main antagonist SO self-aware and still leaning into the ideas others have of him without shame (the fact that he continued the song the others sang about him was genuinely Awesome).
Just in GENERAL the fact that none of the characters in this show have any shame about who they are as people, except Grace's own issues with her sexuality, which still don't make her shameful of her Personality, just of her behavior, was SO interesting to see.
And the way the music between Peter and Stephanie was almost straight up pop-music love songs was really a bit of a key change in my opinion, in a great way! Their songs sounded like what you'd hear on the radio or in a mainstream movie musical, really modern and interesting when played against more traditional musical songs throughout the show.

I'll be honest, the hatchefield trilogy has been truly hurting my soul because it's a bunch of musicals parodying the exact kind of movies/stories I've never watched. Alien abduction/invasion, cosmic horror, slasher films. No experience with them, and I can't understand any of the references they make.
I had to have my husband (big horror fan) explain Guy Who Doesn't LIke Musicals references because I didn't get like Any of them at first and hated the musical. Everything it did seemed so random and out of place and incongruent. But after having the ""weird"" Stuff explained, and seeing how well it actually put different cliches and iconic scenes together, I love TGWDLM.
Then we got to Black Friday and Both REALLY didn't like it at all. We couldn't click with it and were really disappointed.
I watched this worrying that it would be more of the same as Black Friday.
But This was as good as TGWDLM, and is in fact so good I kind of want to go rewatch Black Friday and see if I like it better after some time away from it. O.o",2,@livinginfictions,False,False,False,0,Nerdy Prudes

The lords in black don't exist in the same way we do, which means that They are capable of interacting with us in thousands of different ways. Otherwise, why would 1 person be enough for all of them? They would all get a piece of him and do it all. Be something different whether that be their flesh. Their mind, their thoughts, their ideas. That's how they do it. But They might feel as if we're cheating them as They rather take the whole thing rather than just a piece. They rather have nothing at all. If they can't take the whole thing. Well, make it a better long-term solution. For instance, tell them that we'll make you public and in return. There's certain laws in the Chrome between the negotiation between us and you and People will be more willing if we only give a piece of almost every one of ourselves and you can get more and more from just those pieces rather than the whole bodies. Because people notice those bodies, it's hard to cover up those bodies. We have limits when we give up entire bodies. We have no limits when you give up just a piece. A chocolate flesh that might grow back. A feeling a dream a soul. Just a piece. From everyone Will at the liberty least equal 10 Whole people rather A month rather than the 1 person you get a month.

notice how instantly calmer and nicer he became when the nerds unintentionally put him through a form of immersion therapy, giving him the opportunity to personally confront a tangible representation of his fear. thats something not even the anti-bullying courses could do! because those were about trying to squash his behavior into something more acceptable, rather than identifying and addressing the causes behind his behavior",52,@KTr0ck,False,False,True,11,Nerdy Prudes

 I could be entirely wrong, but I think one of the games was The guy who doesn't like musicals and it was started by The Professor possibly asking to make his musical dream into a reality, another game was Black Friday and Wiggly was going to win and I like to imagine him sending the nuke to the russians as him basically flipping the table, why start WW 3 if you are going to take over the world anyways?

 As for The Lords in Black as players, I'd say Wiggly is the rage quitter that flips the table, Blinky watches over the table to make sure people are follwing the rules, Pokey is the try hard, Tinky is the player that obsesses on one thing in the game, and Nibbly just wants to have stuff.

Upset that they tied their hands up, by saying, that only specific gender identities can play specific Gender identities (even if the characters are written not by those identities (and even if straight people can play LGB characters, and LGB people, can also play straight folks (or even when they are Bi play MLM characters))) which makes me as a Gender fluid feeling left out of the party, but I can see reason why they think it's a good idea to be that way, and at least that way I discover a decent –ê–∫—Ç—Ä–∏—Å—Å–æ (Russian is superior, when it comes to This pronounce, deal with it) Jae Hughes",0,@AlinaAniretake,False,False,True,41,Nerdy Prudes

Ugy05Yh5yxG9arEDDVt4AaABAg,"As someone who absolutely adores ""The Guy who didn't like Musicals"" and it unironically being one of my favourite musicals, I knew ""Nerdy Prudes must Die"" had quite a hard, almost unfair peak to top for me, and honestly I really enjoyed this show! The music being a highlight!

So far in the Hatchetfield series it feels like they either nail the music or the story, and before this show  (to me personally) Only TGWDLM nailed both. But Nerdy Prudes must Die had some absolute bangers, and the story was engaging, the characters were a joy to watch together, and the story added to the overacting Hatchetfield narrative in an enjoyable way without being too dependent on existing shows.

Black Friday missed the mark for me, as the main characters all felt so disconnected. The music was great but the plot felt split between The president and the General, two different groups of characters in the mall, and the main cult lady, and at no real point did all characters come together and interact before the very end, and even then it felt unearned? Like... Wouldn't the little girl be super freaked out by the couple just randomly not attacking her anymore? Idk, it's one of those shows I watched once, thought ""ok"" and then just enjoyed music.

But Nerdy Prudes must Die feels like a great return to form with a strong group of  core characters, a strong supporting cast, a strong villain, and a fun and engaging narrative using the tropes of the genre it's set in to it's fullest. It sparked my interest in the Hatchetfield series again and I'm very excited to see where it goes from now!

The Guy who Didn't Like Musicals might still be my favourite, but Nerdy Prudes must Die is a damn close second!

(this is of course just my opinion on the shows, this is in no way trying to take away anything from all the hard work put into all 3 shows, just the fact that these people are talented and hard working enough to give us so many well put together musicals is an absolute marvel, and I will stick around to consume anything this gang produces‚ù§)",12,@actinganimagus,False,False,False,0,Nerdy Prudes

It drives that concept home again and again just by calling back to that one line of that song as the concept also shows itself repeatedly through the dialogue. The mayor‚Äôs disregard for his daughter, Grace influenced by her hyper-religious parents, Max fighting the skeleton because otherwise his dad will call him a cock for being weak‚Ä¶under the eldritch gods the real horror is in how people hurt each other, just like any good horror imo.

UgyoYG2SGV9XIfdOxJt4AaABAg,"Rewatching this, I never realized how much double-meanings is in ""High School is Killing me"" (Spoiler warning for the entire show):
- The first few lines not only works as the cries of Richie who is killed, but also still works when the song changes key, making the lyrics about being in High School instead of being dead. (ex: ""The Blood is all but draining from my head"" could be both Richie losing blood, but also blood not running to his head when he needs it in school.)
- ""The nightmare started there but now has spread"" refers to the Waylon's house, as the accident occurred there but then ""spread"" to all of Hatchetfield.
- Ruth's verse perfectly described her death. ""I'm scared"" refers to her emotion during the scene and ""Someone comes for me when I'm unprepared"" is referring to Max and his sudden appearance.
- The two initial singers are Richie and Ruth, both of whom dies. Making both their verses work as both cries from dead people, and like said above, as complaints about being in High School. 
- Stephanie said ""There's an unspoken bond between us"", a reference to their not-spoken-out-loud love for each other.
- ""Grace, just be cool"" and Grace replying with ""Never"" is almost ironic seeing that she did not keep her cool once in this entire musical.

She's going to murder everyone like the Waylons and Sherman's mom did. By using The Black Book, she's giving The Lords in Black purchase in the world to start a world ending event.

Ugw16FkE3xN2G4HZtDN4AaABAg,"¬†@haukenot3345¬† cool. So it's kind of like, if a character were Racist, the extra layer that should've been added, is the fact that he hates Chocolate, associated with color of race he hates (Even if that plays no role in his character at all). 

Like, if in the end Jason, while begging for his life said ""please don't kill me, I didn't even wanted to go out with you, I just wanted to make my boyfriend jealous"" and she was like ""you're what?!"" and Jason was like ""wait, you aren't one of those...?"" and ends with Grace saying ""Run, you scum of earth"" - then I see how the line with her being a Lgbtq+ phobic, could've worked in theory. While here, it's just an extra fact about her personal life, that I am not sure we needed to know about.

And I like the implication, that her wanting to punish J√§ggerman for her insecurities, her making decision to ""bury the body"", not obeying the authorities and running with a ""fucking gun"", and by the end manipulating someone into a trap - is not enough to make the twist at the end making sence (should I even mention Black Book and Lords in Black influence (something that is shown in other Hatchetworks, so I don't count it in list of Foreshadowings, since I am more into something working as it's own thing))?). We definitely needed that extra layer of religious bigotry (which btw, doesn't make her more dimensional villain. She still does that, because of her religious beliefs, as all her other actions (with the exception of cops and corpse situations, where she basically just tries to cover her ass up (which is, in fact, gives her extra dimension of a character))).",1,@AlinaAniretake,False,False,True,41,Nerdy Prudes

All I am trying to do is have a conversation. To be clear:  At least when it comes to Rudy, I did not read her character as bisexual until that line by Grace. She was a chaotic character and that's fine in its own right, but it did irk me because it felt like a very unpleasant trope to have a character that is clearly designed to be conventionally unappealing, but who also is perpetually horny in a very indiscriminate way. Her solo after the barbeque monologues seemed to me like an ""I want""- song for her character, suggesting that she didn't really want to fit into the middle-class suburban boxes available to her, but nevertheless was looking for a place to belong. The bisexuality remark by Grace made me reconsider her character as queer, and I am grateful that this bit of nuance was added. You may be right that it doesn't really add as much to Grace's character. I do feel it adds a certain layer of depth, but it's definitely not a new character trait, just an elaboration of what is already there.",6,@haukenot3345,False,False,True,41,Nerdy Prudes

UgztISdo3kHUdwoYuG54AaABAg,"¬†@sofiazin6743¬† Okay. First off: I warned you. I‚Äôm going to try to be brief; this is still going to be very long. Not to mention, some of these are things other commenters noticed, so it‚Äôs a group effort.

The Costumes
‚ÄúWe all hold court in your own tongue and form‚Äù does not just mean ‚Äúwe look like humans and speak English so you understand us.‚Äù They went a step further and picked a different high-school stereotype to establish their own hierarchy in a way the teens would understand:
1. Wiggly is the most obvious, with the varsity jacket, the suit and tie, and the crown. Coupled with his slight British accent, he‚Äôs the prom king/preppy jock/AP senior student with seven scholarships secured. The king of high school, basically. Makes sense; he‚Äôs the leader. (And Jon steals the scene.)
2. Nibbly is the girl with the gossip, the one that spends hours fixing her makeup, trying to look cute and approachable so she can just spill all the tea with her friends and ruin relationships. So, queen bee/head cheerleader/captain of the dance team. Makes sense; Nibbly‚Äôs got quite a mouth on him and always hungers for more. Not to mention, the visor covers Kim‚Äôs eyes, which accentuates her mouth. Perfect.
3. Blinky: fly on the wall. That obvious loner in the corner who knows everything because he spent all of his time just listening, hoodie pulled over his head, no one knows what he‚Äôs up to. He watches, emphasized by the gigantic glasses. Not to mention, the bright orange hair is the same color as Blinky‚Äôs sclera, if I remember correctly.
4. Tinky: Either the sports guy (with the goggles and the fur jacket) or the bad boy delinquent. Perfect for a bastard, as he is frequently called that. Even has his tool of the trade with him. (Not to mention Curt went hard with the mania.)
5. Pokey: The beret, the sparkly jacket, the mask, the SFX makeup? Theatre kid. Head of the drama club. Obvious. There‚Äôs even a behind-the-scenes picture of the LiB posing like their characters, and Pokey‚Äôs got that Hamlet-with-the-skull pose. https://starkid.fandom.com/wiki/Nerdy_Prudes_Must_Die/Gallery/Behind_the_Scenes_Photos?file=NPMD_BTS_%28104%29.jpg (off-topic, he‚Äôs tall. Taller than I thought.)
But all of them have fur on their costumes, which I think calls back to their dolls in Nightmare Time (they had dolls of themselves similar to Wiggly‚Äôs‚Äìlittle furry monsters). This could also imply that their true forms have fur as well? That‚Äôs more of a guess.
The Choreography
They all have their own little dance they do (resting animations?) that emphasize their powers: Blinky uses a hand-telescope, Pokey keeps moving his mask like Hamlet with the skull, Nibbly keeps licking the lollipop, Tinky has this jerky dance that goes from crouching to standing, and Wiggly‚Ä¶well, I can‚Äôt really tell what the angled hand waving represents. I wish I could connect it to Cthullu somehow, since Wiggly seems to be inspired by that. Someone commented that their movements might be jerky because they aren‚Äôt used to taking human form; that‚Äôs something to think about. And then, they cycle through those dances, so they don‚Äôt belong to any one of them.
But the shoulder-moving and the stepping as one is such a sharp contrast to the dances that you remember they could be operating under one goal, and that they have one goal together. And though we speculate, they don‚Äôt tell us what that goal is. What does that imply?
The Dialogue
I can only speak for Wiggly here, since we haven‚Äôt heard the others before. Maybe it‚Äôs part of the glamour, but Wiggly sounds different from the high-pitched psycho child we heard in Black Friday; almost normal, with hints of his childish speech pattern slipping in. He does try to be polite, but from the beginning of the dialogue you can tell that he's mad at, maybe even disgusted by, this song and dance. The hand-wringing adds to that too. ‚ÄúWiggly wants his wrath‚Äù, right? And as the convo continues he starts to lose it more and more. Specifically during the line ‚Äúwhatever we want?!‚Äù he just drops all formality. This has to be intentional‚Äìjust a reminder that the LiB don‚Äôt actually look like this; they can and will snap you with a look. Wiggly wearing his toy version on a backpack adds to this too‚Äìthe Lovecraftian fear of the peripheral, of things not being what they are if you‚Äôre not looking at them. Basically, Jon killed it, again, and made the leader of the LiB even scarier.
The Blocking
Aka, where they‚Äôre standing. Because there‚Äôs a fourth wall, they don‚Äôt stand in a straight-up pentagram, but that‚Äôs what it‚Äôs supposed to be. They surround the teens on all sides and cover all the exits off-stage, which sells how trapped the teens are. It‚Äôs great and intimidating, but the LiB don‚Äôt move. With how chaotic the lights are, I expected them to be running around or something. I bet something in the book keeps them from advancing on the teens, so the court can be held on equal footing.
Which makes it even more terrifying when Wiggly just‚Ä¶approaches. Runs his hand across Pete‚Äôs neck. Lights up when Steph realizes what he‚Äôs asking her to do. If anyone doubted Wiggly being the most powerful, here‚Äôs the proof. 
The Lights
This one is pretty self-explanatory. To emphasize the otherworldly aspects of the LiB, there are a lot of lights, all with a cycle of six colors: green (wiggly), pink (nibbly), purple (blinky), orange (tinky), blue (pokey), and white for normalcy. Each of them have their own colored light on them, and many other lights flash when they get angry. I did count them just for kicks, and yeah, there are 26 active lights in that scene.
The Song
I could break down the lyrics. I don‚Äôt want to. This is getting super long. 
Someone commented that the LiB go up a half-step every time they sing, spiking the tension every time. I have listened, and maybe my ears are shot, but I think they‚Äôre on to something. 
The song itself is a blacktop song. Meaning it‚Äôs heavily reminiscent of a nursery rhyme, or songs you‚Äôd chant when you‚Äôre playing hopscotch, double dutch, ring-around-the-rosy, on the blacktop during recess. This is how I know Wiggly‚Äôs normal voice is that freaky number from Black Friday. The LiB could be thousands of years old, but at the heart of it they‚Äôre still just a bunch of spoiled child-acting psychos playing five-square with Hatchetfield. On their own personal blacktop (black and white?).

Ugx5c0EouLdLfLQrgRd4AaABAg,"¬†@LunaWitcherArt¬† I actually think we might catch hints of the general now, and PEIP might be on the horizon in future Hatchetfield content. I have a theory that--even though Black Friday and TGWDLM happened in separate timelines--Black Friday happened before TGWDLM in the great multiversal timeline. 
I'm not about to go back and check, but I believe the general said that the Black and White existed outside of all dimensions, meaning the Lords in Black and Webby are aware of every timeline. 
By extension, that could also apply to other creatures in the Black and White...like the general. Like Wiggly and Webby in Black Friday, the general was able to reach out to the psychic-inclined Lex (and Hannah, implied). While I have no idea what state the general is in, I think he could be able to influence other versions of himself in other timelines. If you think about it, this explains a few things about the way the general acts in TGWDLM that I just found to be...strange. I won't go into it if you don't want me to, but the interdimensional stuff is my favorite part of the Hatchetfield series.

UgwDQCqINBXFD4UL-SZ4AaABAg,"As much as I love the rest of Starkid and Tin Can Bros... The worth of this musical is mostly fanservice - and even that is not present enough. The songs are not nearly as catchy, the storyline is not as captivating, the jokes just do not land as well. My personal take is that, like in Black Friday, SK tried to make a more serious musical while keeping the Starkid soul. In my very biased approach, this worked with BF,  but failed here. The Gen Z references fall flat. And no serious approach can work within a Hatchetfield High School setting. For future musicals, I (a VERY biased and non-professional spectator) would love to see more light humor OR more connection with the source material (in this case, the life of a high school kid). For instance, Mean Girls, a high school comedy classic, hits harder because of its understanding of adolescent culture that goes beyond ""ha-ha, here are the bullies, and here are the nerds, and look! they depend on their phones"". Mind you, this is still a job well done and I did have a good time with it, but I just could not help but feel that some unique Starkid spirit is missing from this show. Maybe I am the only one, and maybe my opinion is ""wrong"", but this is my impression of NPMD so far. All I know is, I will be rewatching TGWDLM, Black Friday, Twisted and the other masterpieces way more often than NPMD.

UgwL3X22sq9vmL2QRqt4AaABAg,"¬†@Jms_Hcy¬† These three shows have long been referred to as 'The Hatchetfield Trilogy.' Even before Nerdy Prudes was announced, people knew this would be a trilogy. That doesn't necessarily mean that they're going to stop making Hatchetfied shows, but the originally-conceived trilogy is now finished. Think like how in Star Wars, Return of the Jedi was the end of the trilogy, but the franchise carried on.

I'm hoping that now that the trilogy that they originally planned is finished, that means they're looking at releasing community theatre rights so other people can put the shows on. It doesn't necessarily mean that I think they're done entirely, but they've definitely finished creating this era/trilogy of Hatchetfield.",9,@matthewlynch6658,False,False,True,145,Nerdy Prudes

16:25: Not really a ref or callback, but I just find it very funny Corey and Mariah play father and daughter like they did in TGWDLM.

48:41: This whole little sequence is really just a callback to Paul & Ted's chat before Paul left to go to Beanie's in TGWDLM. Both are even referring to Lauren's character specifically, lmao.

48:49: Refers to Homeless Guy from TGWDLM.

49:35 - 49:43: ""Yeah. I don't want to, though."" and, ""You're fucking useless, Pete!"" Both callbacks to lines Paul & Ted, respectively, say in TGWDLM.

1:16:08: ""Shut the fuck up, Ruth!"" is delivered very similarly to how Joey delivered ""Shut the fuck up, Paul!"" In TGWDLM.

1:22:19: Man in a hurry.

1:23:41: Gerald from Black Friday. Even calls Linda, his wife and main antagonist of Black Friday, to get his lawyer (Gary Goldstein) on the line.

1:40:20: ""Show Me Your Hands"" plays in the background.

1:40:41: IT'S THEM YOU GUYS OH MY GOD IT'S THEM

1:40:51: ""Cup of Roasted Coffee"" plays in the background.

1:41:15: Same lines as the ones she says in TGWDLM.

1:41:18: Pete is the Hot Chocolate boy.

1:41:23: ""I have been waiting for what feels like five fucking years..."" And that's because it has been.

1:41:37: Emma spits in Pete's drink, something she claims to have always done in TGWDLM.

Nightmare time is an amazing experience, but if you don't have that amount of time to spend, definitely watch black friday and read plot summaries of those nightmare time episodes. It'll give a lot more context to the hatchetfield universe.

there is also the 'nightmare time' series which actually establishes and clarifies a lot of the lore and builds on it. it's where we meet grace chastity for the first time, in the stories 'perky's buds' and 'abstinence camp' in season 2. we meet steph and pete for the first time in 'abstinence camp' also, they're the main characters in that story along with grace. i recommend checking it out! if you're interested in the lore  and world-building around hatchetfield, i especially recommend it - however the format is a little different than typical starkid stuff as they started it over zoom in 2020, and it's told almost like a radio drama with nick lang reading the script and the cast acting as their characters - season 2 is a lot more produced and edited and stuff while being in a similar format to season 1, just with the songs filmed more professionally like proper music videos. it put me off at first with the format, however once i got into it i got over that fairly quickly!",0,@leilanyx,False,False,True,17,Nerdy Prudes

UgyuOnPWLwt6we1471x4AaABAg,"¬†@bel410la¬† !!!! I think another point towards Max having a genuine crush on Grace is that he punched out his friend that called her a ""two-bagger"" and defended her to him when she likely couldn't even see or hear that happening, so it's not like doing that could've helped him win her over. I think there are less signs that Grace has anything deeper than sexual attraction to Max, but probably the strongest evidence towards her having some actual non-horny feelings towards him is in the bridge of Dirty Girl. Like the word ""love"" is used a couple times in the song, but almost definitely those were all used as metonyms for sex. But in the line you mentioned, it's harder to think of ""loving"" as having any other meaning than what that word is at face value. Grace also sings ""You're breaking hearts for the fun and it's bloody"", and it's interesting that she mentions Max's reputation for breaking /hearts/, especially in a bridge where she is expressing her concerns over this new desire she has. So it can easily be read as Grace being worried for her own heart being broken by Max, and therefore, she has feelings for him, or felt at risk of developing them.

This got /incredibly/ away from me and this maybe got a little unhinged, but all this to say: I think the argument can be made that both of them actually liked each other beyond sex, but I'd say if Grace did have feelings for Max, they were not to the extent that Max's feelings were for her (I mean she did kill him twice, meanwhile he never directly targeted her when he was a vengeful ghost, despite A: going after all the ""Nerdy Prudes"" and Grace being the only one of them that could actually be considered a prude, and B: her actually being the most responsible for his death and body dismemberment).

UgyuOnPWLwt6we1471x4AaABAg,"¬†@sunshinerose7729¬† I agree, This whole musical can be said that everything happened because Grace was horny, whether or not she had feelings for him or not, though I think she did a little bit. She had to 'get rid' of Max because I think she could see a potential of him being able to break through her Prudy-ness and get to something deeper including losing her Chastity like at the end. He was too tempting to deny, which I think is really funny. 
A lot of reactors didn't like Dirty Girl because it made them uncomfortable, and while I see that, I was uncomfortable the first time I watched, before I realized it was my favorite song... I think it was necessary to show why Grace wanted him gone, because he was close to getting her to lose her virginity because she was so horny for him.

UgyuOnPWLwt6we1471x4AaABAg,"To add my own two cents to the replies. I'm 100% convinced Max also wanted him sexually the same way Grace did. Considering, after Max punches the shit out of the dude and he asks why she calls her a 'forbidden fruit'. He wants her cus she's not supposed to be unattainable. The main reason I believe he defends Grace is to save his own ego, cus he can't have anyone devaluing the 'unattainable prize' he's actively throwing himself to.

Not to mention, hes quite literally a horrible person and the two weeks he's dead solidifies that claim. We know he has an unexplored, more subtle sides to him, like how hes definitely smarter than his 'social role', how the kindest thing someone's done for him was plan out a scare party, and the cuddling after sex thing. But I dont believe these contributes to Max actually (or at least initially) having any romantic feelings for Grace other than that he has quirks outside of being an overall terrible person.",0,@allterran7093,False,False,True,12,Nerdy Prudes

Ugz4l_VkZS4PJg7KHqJ4AaABAg,"FAN THEORY!!! we know by the end of show Grace has become fully enchanted with the books powers right? Seemingly due to her traumatic experiences of sacrificing the thing that mattered most to her plus everything else she experienced. 

But what if it was planned the whole time? At 1:11:34 she wakes up from ""a horrible nightmare"" of Max being ""dead"" and ""angry"". But little does she know at this point that she wasnt just having a dream. From Black Friday we know that beings in the black and white have the ability to give humans the ability to predict the future, plus certain humans have powers right?

What if this entire time The Lords were preparing Grace to become a mouth piece of theirs just like Wiley was?? Her nightmare wasnt actually a nightmare? It was a message from one of the Lords instead. 

Perhaps, even before this  the Lords may have intervened to set off this chain of events? Like making a floor fall through? Under one, Max Jagerman? And then later bringing him back to further the chain of events that would eventually lead to Grace Chasity becoming adicted to the feeling of taking souls? 

I feel like this would also add context onto The Lord later saying ""We've been watching you Gracie. Someone's being a little naughty!"" Vs the mere recognizing of the Spankoffski name? IDK

If you want to showcase a bully in the school setting, you should probably do it by the era in which the setting is in. If it's set in 2021, then it's gonna be less wedgies and wet willies and more cyber stalking and ACTUAL STALKING. Or even the rumours are fucking dumb. Like, ""he wears a bow tie so he's rich and thinks he's better than us"" how about ""he's a social outcast because he got caught in his ex's garage"" or some shit like that.

My biggest complaint with this show is probably the ending. I kind of wish that it didn't have the world ending situation it almost brings down the show but Grace being so insane makes it a lot better as it does make sense for her character.

UgxTQKf685nVMRCprWN4AaABAg,"Huh they changed a lot of lines in Hatchettown to make more cameos! Originally, Don was accused instead of Ziggy, the cop was accused instead of the Man in a Hurry, Karen (Chasety, Grace's mom) was being accused instead of Charlie, and Jerry was accused (and apparently a journalist) instead of Gerald! He even screamed that ""it was Girl Gery that dirty girl!"" Meanwhile the cop has a moment where he genuinely doubts himself and it's hilarious. Karen was offended that they suggested that the victims would end up on her displays. Don is a voluntary counselor and certainly doesn't love killing!

Also is Charlie supposed to be Charles from Yellow Jacket? Name change? (EDIT: just a nickname from the town! He's credited as Charles. It's somehow hilarious they call him Charlie, this guy is just sus incarnated lol) Maybe the town calls him by a nickname while he introduces himself more seriously/professionally back there. I also assumed that he was sort of from out of town because, well, shady billionaire felt a bit strange but it fits Hatchetfields' craziness. I'm glad he, Ziggy, Man in a Hurry, and Gerald got a cameo as they're Nightmare Time characters and incredible. I wonder if that was how it was supposed to be originally but the actors couldn't do it or it would mess with who played who since they couldn't add 4 more cast members to the ensemble? Anyhow, it's neat to see them added in. Hope it'll bring more attention to Nightmare Time (2). Glad to see it be promoted at the end, it did become important to the lore. If you're not sure about watching it because Season 1 wasn't your jam, do it! It's even better. The songs, at the very least, are worth it. Here's to a possible Nightmare Time 3, I just can't get enough of Hatchetfield!

I do have some doubts about using the cast recording but the fact that they changed the lines only for the proshot and not the recording is fun! I like that the recording is closer to the live show. I miss having a well-recorded version of the live songs but my God the mixing in the recording is amazing. Literal Monster became a bop and my favorite song instantly!

I'd recommend any fan to get the digital ticket, it's easy and doesn't cost much. I got the opening night (couldn't wait any further or even until we got subtitles because I was so hyped!) and it's INCREDIBLE. Just the tiny changes in Hatchettown make it worth it!

EDIT as I watch: Steph also does a ""what??"" gesture as Pete throws his hot chocolate away and Grace goes to the far left as she ""sits"" and falls over. Strongly recommend the ticket of opening night because it was hilarious! Sad they didn't add these moments because they make the show even better!

I'm not sure about this one but in either the opening or closing performance, I think Paul was straight-up killed by the cop or at least choked. He had a line about not being able to breathe. Might have been a risky line and the police brutality was also very present throughout the show (and every time the police shows up in any of the Hatchetfields works) so there's not much being lost. I like to think Paul survived this time.

Grace also said ""pervs"" before but I do like the change to ""dudes"". She would absolutely make a difference between guys and gals and be more inclined to blame the men. Poor Jason, he only did what she asked and seemed comfortable with!",5,@ondiiina,False,False,False,0,Nerdy Prudes

UgxK45PpuymlFrD9r3h4AaABAg,"¬†@gameraspindlethorn6229¬† No. It's not just because she's a teenager, and it goes beyond her just being a teenager. TL;DR if you don't feel like reading my wall of text, she's the eponymous Nerdy Prude, and she's not a very good person about it.

Starkids, when creating her character back in Nightmare Tales, went out of their way to specifically make her a Christian Evangelist. Because of that, she's basically a fundamentalist (or as I like to call them, hypocrites) and it shows. You know how Max, even before he becomes a wraith, constantly hassles the nerds for being nerdy prudes? Well, there's only one character in the entire musical who is definitely both a nerd and a prude at the same exact time, and it's Grace. And since she's a fundamentalist, it adds on an extra level. It's why Grace is nasty to basically everyone around her, why she takes to the Book so well (she also exemplifies the traits of the deadly sin Wrath as she's quick to punish anyone who crosses her) and why she plays the blame game the whole musical. She's a terrible and selfish person not because she's a teenager, but because of how she was raised, she just thinks she's better then everyone else. Otherwise, what kind of person is she who gets a guy to kiss her on the first date (which isn't even unusual) and then blames him for doing exactly what she asked? Or what kind of person is she who makes a plan to scare someone simply on the basis that she was horny, doesn't have a problem with her allies getting beat up and then overrules the entire group by burying the body instead doing the bible says and talking to the state (the cops in this case) about the accident? Being honest with the cops, which is what Jesus literally says multiple times before hanging on the cross, would had removed most of the groups reality problems, meaning they only had to deal with the Wraith that Max became.",0,@hisnitch,False,False,True,21,Nerdy Prudes

UgxbL6Spkufe0RVIDOZ4AaABAg,"i can‚Äôt tell if just for once is amazing or if i‚Äôm just being crazy. like there‚Äôs so much nuance here for readings of ruth‚Äôs character that it feels weird.

it‚Äôs established that ruth is extremely isolated and just wants to be close to people physically and emotionally to the point where being touched causes her to lose her faculties and the idea of peeing in the same space as other people is ‚Äúgreater than [she] ever imagined.‚Äù and like, that‚Äôs not too out there. that‚Äôs kind of an archetypal loser. that part is easy to understand and she‚Äôs written mostly for jokes.

until this song, apparently?? maybe??? i have NO clue. like she performs this number so convincingly and with such gravity and depth that it feels like she actively DOES process the themes of disillusionment with life in middle age and the casual agony of time passing by, and parts of her performance just kind of betray that she‚Äôs deeply unhappy where she is, sure, but she also knows that she could very well end up unhappy even if she gets what she wants, which she‚Äôs probably still developing an idea of.

so what we end up with is this image of a girl who simultaneously wants anything other than the life of isolation and torment she currently leads, but is also self-aware of the fact that the idyllic life of interpersonal closeness she so desires is something that might not make her happy even if she does everything right. in spite of this, she still covets it. 

her character expands fucking DRAMATICALLY out of this song, because what she wants becomes so much more than to be With People in a way that doesn‚Äôt hurt her. in this moment, we learn she has a desire to be seen and known, with the conflicting aspect of her not knowing how to handle that sort of thing in even the smallest doses. there might be a bit of an unmet desire for attention there as well, but it‚Äôs unclear how much of that is the character she‚Äôs playing and how much of that is actually her.

and then after we get this, like, ridiculously nuanced, layered understanding of ruth, she just dies scared and alone. maybe i‚Äôm reading too much into this, but like, goddamn, that‚Äôs just kinda fucking brutal.

UgwGnpxErRDhUvRHA3p4AaABAg,"You know what? Nerdy Prudes Must Die is one of the most fun pieces of media I‚Äôve ever seen. I‚Äôve been following Starkid since I was a young teenager and since they were college kids accidentally going viral with a Harry Potter parody. 

I‚Äôve seen them knock it out of the park and I‚Äôve seen dips in quality. Admittedly I thought I had kind of aged out of liking their new stuff. I thought The Guy Who Didn‚Äôt Like Musicals was fun in concept but ultimately impossible to pull off without being cringeworthy. I thought Black Friday was more interested in recapturing whatever made all the new, young fans go wild about TGWDLM with their YouTube compilations than it was in standing on its own. I felt like both of them were mostly vehicles for Jeff Blim to write songs for himself to screech all over the stage. I liked Trail to Oregon a little better but I‚Äôve been really bummed that favs of mine like AJ Holmes, Meredith Stepien, Joe Walker & Brian Holden seem to have moved on since Firebringer. Yet Starkid has seemed more popular than ever the last five years in what I‚Äôve come to think of as the ‚ÄúBlim Age.‚Äù So in what I thought of as a quality dip, where the seemingly younger fans have been eating it all up, I sadly came around to the idea that Starkid‚Äôs stuff just wasn‚Äôt for me anymore. 

But then they put on THIS FUCKING SHOW. I was doubled over with laughter and tears streaming from my face at times, and the moments of scariness hit so much more than the other Hatchetfield shows. Will Branner is an absolute diamond; I haven‚Äôt seen someone ham it up like this since Jim Carrey‚Äôs prime, and no actor has ever made me laugh so hard from what I can recall. Angela Giarratana was another standout; in my opinion you can really tell her Black Friday role was written for someone else, but they struck gold with her here giving the unhinged goblin energy that modern Smosh fans love her for. Joey Richter has reached his final form if you ask me; NPMD is the performance of his life and I‚Äôm honestly so proud of how he‚Äôs evolved as a comedic actor and singer since 2009. 

Nerdy Prudes Must Die stands so proudly on its own two feet and the references to past shows are bonuses rather than the whole point. In that way I feel it triumphs where Black Friday fizzled. It blends horror, comedy and music seamlessly where TGWDLM was somewhat clunky and awkward. This show has so much heart and it makes me really excited for what they do next, even if it happens to *still* be in Hatchetfield. Jeff Blim and the Lang brothers should all be so proud of the show they created here. NPMD and Beetlejuice are the benchmarks anyone should look to if they‚Äôre writing a horror comedy musical. NPMD is in a very very tight race with Twisted for my absolute favourite Starkid show. I didn‚Äôt think that was possible.",13,@lucasfroese5123,False,False,False,0,Nerdy Prudes

1:10:41 Jon absolutely fucking knocked it out of the park here. That ""I'm not a loser!"" got me SO damn good, I started bawling my eyes out. The whole buildup throughout the song was already amazing, but that finale brought it all together and made me feel like I was going to implode. Jon was able to convey such heavy emotions with that one line, I truly can't put it into words how much that has affected me.
Don't get me wrong, Jon has never been a bad singer to begin with, but it's obvious that his voice has gotten a lot stronger since TGWDLM. And it was BEAUTIFUL!

Generally, the way Richie's life came to its end hit me like a damn brick. He was finally feeling content for once, finally happy to be alive, and then had to die immediately after that realization. That was so incredibly sad and frustrating once I realized what was happening. (I had forgotten that we knew from the very beginning that he was going to die.)

Other than that, I just have to applaud all the people involved (cast, writers, crew, etc.) for once again creating a masterpiece and also posting it publicly without charge. We've been blessed once again, thank you so much for all you do <3",237,@echofromafar,False,False,False,1,Nerdy Prudes

It wasn‚Äôt until maybe a year ago that I watched Jon do the voice and had to rethink everything, and now that he‚Äôs actually showing up as this humanoid version of Wiggly, it‚Äôs almost like a confirmation that yes, he did voice Wiggly in Black Friday. Not to mention, the way he played his voice to sound somewhat normal with a few hints toward the terror in BF shows incredible vocal control.

Ugzyihy8Yi2GZSkv0aZ4AaABAg,"¬†@abydosianchulac2¬† You've tapped into the one thing I love talking about in musicals like this. You've covered most of the bases, but I would like to add a few suggestions: 
1. I agree that Blinky is a loner, but the kind that literally no one notices because he watches and does nothing else. I'd suggest a fly-on-the-wall archetype, the kind that no one would notice even if they were in the room. With the dark colors and the orange hair spilling out, it's easy for Blinky's features to be unnoticeable, sans the gigantic specs of couse.
2. Are those dice on Wiggly's sweater? Or pins? It would make sense with the ""roll of the dice"" lyric, but perhaps I don't know much about old-school preppy fashion, or why he'd have them. 
3. I agree with you on the techwear gamer aesthetic for Tinky. Looking into his lore, he plays with time by giving citizens his toybox (the cube), and after he breaks them, he kills them and puts their souls in his box and makes them run in an eternal maze for his amusement. So in a brutally dark way, he is ""that gamer kid.""

So I'm just writing this as a comment to come back to and add stuff to that I realized on repeat watches, if you noticed something that really stuck out to you feel free to add to this :)
The whole ""Church of the Starry Children"" thing is just following that old Starkid joke of the lords in black being the audience, literally them saying ""Starkid"" without saying starkid I feel kinda stupid for not putting that together on the first watch lol.
The line delivery Max does for ""You lost...everything"" is so similar to Paul's ""Emma...I'm sorry...you lost..."" in TGWDLM, I wonder if its something to do with the LiB maybe making them say it? He also has a very similar delivery to the father in Trail to Oregon when he says ""what are you"" and I think that one is just straight up a direct reference
Oh God the ""you kinda look like the homeless guy"" line is just a reference to the fact Joey played him I feel stupid
Max has a tattoo in dirty girl soup but I can't really make out what it is exactly, it looks like one of the symbols is the nighthawks so maybe it's something connecting the other two productions to this one?",2,@Penquinn14,False,False,False,0,Nerdy Prudes

And the movie is actually set more towards our time because they mention they were the class of 2023 meaning they started their highschool journey a few years prior. I honestly do just think they took a huge amount of inspiration from both Lovecraftian horror and slasher films from the 80's 90's and 200's but then again if they are in the same universe as some of Stephen king's novels, that would be just as rad and I love the creativity in this community of people to help spawn ideas I personally would have never thought of before.

He fails miserably over and over, and eventually gets stuck in the past and loses his mind. He then becomes the homeless guy who is also referenced in this.
Tinky, the yellow Lord in Black, gave that power to Ted to mess with him, and Ted (or his soul/mind) is now stuck in endless torture in the toybox (also referred to as the bastards box).

UgxD7CmkYQTMnjF69qx4AaABAg,"Your Honor, the defense would like to prove that Grace Chasity, was in fact, living in Hatchetfield in TGWDLM. Consider these points:
1. In the first mention of Grace, Bill didn‚Äôt explicitly said that Grace was studying at Clivesdale. To paraphrase their conversation:
B: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you date someone at your own school‚Äù
A: ‚ÄúYou just don‚Äôt like Deb‚Äù
Bill, not wanting to lie, then redirected the conversation:
B: ‚ÄúWhy don‚Äôt you date someone like Grace Chasity?‚Äù
The two statements said by Bill don‚Äôt necessarily have a cause-effect relationship. Also, how could Bill know about Grace if he‚Äôs living in HF and can‚Äôt afford to move to CD to be closer to his daughter? Which brings us to the next point:
2.  Bill and Grace go to the same church. Both of them seem like they don‚Äôt miss church. And who would cross a bridge for mass?  Which means that they must live in a reasonable proximity to their local church, in HF. One could argue that, maybe Bill met Grace at a CD church when he was visiting, which brings us to the next point:
3. Bill and Alice both know Grace enough to judge her character. If Grace were in CD, Bill wouldn‚Äôt have known her enough to ‚Äúrecommend‚Äù her to his daughter. Still, it‚Äôs a terrible recommendation. But put yourself in Bill‚Äôs shoe, would you suggest your daughter to date someone who you didn‚Äôt know well enough and only met a few time at church?

Just an analysis I‚Äôve had after rewatching this musical double digit amounts of times in the past couple days, and revising this particular scene especially. Even though it‚Äôs really sweet and adorable to see Max‚Äôs sudden change of heart/being sweet after being maliciously pranked by people he hates and despises, even if the accident was avoided and he didn‚Äôt die in that house, things probably wouldn‚Äôt have gotten better on Max‚Äôs side, if not only just a tiny bit. And I think that Nick, Matt and Jeff did a great job at writing his character to be completely irredeemable. How Max is: ‚ÄúA Literal Monster‚Äù, how even to his friends/teammates before; he was controlling and abusive towards, and even in ‚ÄúNerdy Prudes Must Die‚Äù, the line where he says ‚ÄúYou think I seek revenge? I could give two shits how you buried and left me. Defiled my body. You pushed me off the edge.‚Äù He doesn‚Äôt even seem to care that he died. Because for him, that means he‚Äôs free now and can become the true murderous demon he really is.

So, even though he had that moment of sweetness, I personally think Max was never capable of being redeemed or being a better person. That to his core, he was a murderous, hateful bully and a monster. Round of applause to Will Branner who gave an amazing performance and bringing this character to life! üëèüëèüëè",155,@HCHL99,False,False,False,0,Nerdy Prudes

Since that happened in the past (Ted ‚Äúdisappears‚Äù in 2019) and tinky‚Äôs whole thing is that he is the bastard of time and space, it could be explained up by time travel fuckery. However, Ted time traveling was a result of one of the multiple times the lords in black acted after having their powers being sought out, willingly or accidentally, by the people of hatchedfield (similarly to: Jane‚Äôs a car, the witch in the web, Honey queen, daddy in the nmt series and even directly before the events of Black Friday, giving that both the US and Russia had a portal to the black and White, and Wilber Cross started working with the lords in black). Grace is also not the only person who used the book and that explicitly had to pay a price to do so. Giving that hatchedfield also seems to be surrounded by magic that doesn‚Äôt seem directly related to the lords (based solely on the nmts series) , i wonder If not Grace but the witch who wrote the black book and all the others who used it after her (including Grace) are the one‚Äôs who give the lords in black more and more power.

Roughly the timeline before each story is the same though. Especially Emma and Paul are a decent measure for the musicals.
Emma comes back to Hatchetfield due to her sister dying in the car crash, she starts working at Beanies, and Paul falls for her. This happens everytime before the story starts, but how far along they are changes between them and could be an indication to go off of.

TGWDLM and this one (NPMD) seem to happen within a few months of each other (neighborhood watch isn't the same, but Pete being the hot chocolate kid butting in lines up (especially with the clothing style)).
And Black Friday probably happens after this point between a few months to a year (since Grace Chastity is in highschool in both BF and NPMD).

Ugzyihy8Yi2GZSkv0aZ4AaABAg,"Okay, they're rough, but here were the thoughts I was able to get down on what I saw. And I emphasize, this is what I saw, with my own associations from my formative years and consumed media. Any and all corrections, additions, and comments welcome to clarify what this design vision could have been.

Wiggly ‚Äì leader of the Lords in Black.  The crown is obvious, but he‚Äôs also taken on the form of the jock, not unlike Max, but an elevated, preppy form from the 40s-50s. Letterman sweater combined with class ring, Converse sneaks, collared shirt, and tie say to me semi-formal, mid-century, Ivy-League-collegiate style, so Wiggly‚Äôs at the highest point of high school status: the college-headed senior varsity athlete.

Blinky ‚Äì hardest time with this one. Dark, pulled-up hoodie suggests to me loner, standing on the outside looking inward, emphasized by the sparkly glasses.  If anyone has better ideas, please include them below!

Pokey ‚Äì musical theater Hive mind, so obviously the artistic thespian (only Lord with atypical/theatrical SFX makeup).  Black clothes are common in acting circles as a neutral palette for multiple characters, but turtleneck, beret and all black/monochromatic combo is an old drama club stereotype, drawing from the beatnik styles of the 50s and 60s (see Danny Kaye in ‚ÄúChoreography‚Äù from White Christmas, 1954).  Also black isn't really black, but incredibly dark tone that reflects blue in direct light. Mask held in hand and feathery boa-like collar add performative signaling to the outfit.

Tinky ‚Äì  guy way too into hunting.  Okay, it's less an archetype, but he's the guy in rural schools who has made being a hunter and outdoorsman way too much of his personality.  Flannel overshirt with fur-accented tactical vest and cargo pants, though all monochromatic instead of camo, with tactical goggles on head and hiking boots on feet, carrying box to proudly display his trophies. (In my head that silhouette also screams overenthusiastic techwear gamer, but I am having a harder time reasoning why I'm getting that.)

Nibbly ‚Äì 80s-90s popular girl, ultra-consumeristic, with her visor, knee highs, and fingerless gloves.  Pink fits with Nibbly‚Äôs color, but also overemphasizes mainstream ‚Äúgirly‚Äù presentation. Reasoning behind bold lipstick and oversized lollipop should be obvious.",138,@abydosianchulac2,False,False,True,20,Nerdy Prudes
Ugzyihy8Yi2GZSkv0aZ4AaABAg,¬†@abydosianchulac2¬†  I'd argue Blinky is the gossip girl.  Always listening for the good 'tea'.  The hoodie I think is just an attempt to mimic the doll's single eye while the real give away for the gossip is the long hair and glasses that they're always looking over.  Always knowing what you've done,66,@CaptainDeeYT,False,False,True,20,Nerdy Prudes

Ugzyihy8Yi2GZSkv0aZ4AaABAg,"¬†@abydosianchulac2¬†I never thought about this until seeing your comment and that‚Äôs so cool to think about. For blinky, I agree with the idea of gossip girl or maybe like emo type. For Tinky, I think he‚Äôs more like the bad boy like motorcycle or skater boy. And I agree with Nibbly as a preppy girl and then maybe to add on as like head cheerleader type.

Starting with such a calming ethereal harmony really lulls you into a state of calm only for the lord's in black to suddenly appear with a shocking level of intensity in the music. Then it also just has the most perfect music that really makes you feel the chaotic terror they bring. While the ""we don't give a shit about your phone"" is really funny, it's also a terrifying misstep and feels like you're in actual danger for accidentally pissing them off. While I now love horror and am very rarely scared, I was very easily scared as a kid and that song would've terrified me. The choreo perfectly compliments the song as well. It's also really unique and I don't think I've heard a song like it before. All of the songs here are so damn good and I can (and have) listen to them for hours!

Generic love story stayed generic love story, there wasnt any jokes about it being somewhat absurd or out of nowhere. Jock becoming dead evil force.. I dont see what it is parodying either. What is supposed to be a point of this parody?
Twisted is also a parody, and its making fun of Disney's view on villains, i think its pretty clear.
Bury the body being the plot song with concept of changing the narrative. Okay, and? Like, its alright, but its 1 bit. Then im bringing up lyrics of songs from Twisted i talk about layers of meaning behind them and just beautiful Imaginary (again, sands of time, thousands nights, etc.). And every song is like this, except for comedy ones, and they got smart lines in them too.

Ok so obviously Wiggly is Wiggog. The blue-theatre looking one was referred to as ""Pokey"" so they're Pokotho (probably the one who caused the events in the first musical). Nibblephym is presumably the pink one due to the line ""Nibbleine wants his sacrifice"" showing her as well as her whole thing being about eating & the name featuring the word ""Nibble"". The other 2 are less clear but I'll bet the yellow one is T‚Äônoy Keraxis because ""T'noy"" sounds like ""Toy"", making Biklotep the one with her theme being sight.

Wiggly is Wiggog Y'rath
The blue one is Pokotho

You think this is objectively worse than that? If you liked Twisted more thats fine, but don't act like they haven't objectively done a better job with this because of experience and actually having more of a budget to work with. If you wanna argue that them doing a version of Twisted with the same level of quality they have access to now would be better, thats a different conversation and I'd love to hear about it, but there's no way you think that EVERYTHING is objectively worse about this when its on better equipment and they have an even better idea on what they are capable of.

UgzBYFjabQKUBVDQA9N4AaABAg,"¬†@Penquinn14¬† i dont care about production, best stories are often have no budget. I dont care if somebody likes whatever this was, people dont have to like whatever is objectively better, all i want is for people to not forget about Twisted.
And im absolutely sure Twisted is lifechanging story, cause i witnessed that. The amount of layers its plot has, bright complex characters, funny jokes (toilet themed, sure, i dont know why its bad for some tho.) and truly magical songs. Again, i dont care if someone liked songs from this one, but none of those has stucked in my head, none of the lyrics like ""i love youuu."" and ""school school school."" had any affect on me, and i dont believe that it could affect you either.
Compared to what? ""Sands of time take me back."", ""If you believed in me."", ""Power in me."" etc etc. I dont believe you heard them, otherwise i have no idea how could you say two songs about love with the most generic lyrics and no catchyness about them are objectively better, and all the other ones i cannot physically remember, probably something about school and this uninteresting universe starkid are trying to create.
Your rant about production is honestly confusing, i dont get how this can be your only criteria then it doesnt even matter, but yeah, it is better than almost 9 years ago starkids productions; it wasnt bad at twisted tho, not at all.

We went from generic song about generic revenge to literally talking about defiling a body.

UgyvQU45Fzgs4tUP2sF4AaABAg,"Hi, I‚Äôm a random Starkid fan on the internet, and you didn‚Äôt ask for it, but here are my opinions on all of the songs in order:

1. High School Is Killing Me: Hands down the best opening number they‚Äôve ever done, and one of the best High School themed ensemble numbers in the whole genre of musical theatre.

2. Literal Monster: The whole cast kills it, but obviously Will is the highlight. Dude‚Äôs an absolute powerhouse!

3. Cool as I Think I Am: This is peak Joey Richter. It‚Äôs nice to see him getting another wholesome ‚ÄúI want‚Äù number reminiscent of the days of Starship or Senior Year. He‚Äôs come a long way and everyone knows it!

4. Dirty Girl: Absolutely hysterical. Goes on maybe a little too long for my liking but Angela and Will have incredible chemistry. It‚Äôs honestly a shame we don‚Äôt get to see more of that.

5. Bully the Bully + Bury the Bully: 
Not really a highlight of the show by any means, but the cast play off each other super well in this one and are clearly having a contagious amount of fun!

6. Go Go Nighthawks: This one feels like a song that‚Äôs obligatory in every musical set in a high school and is not super memorable, but the Clivesdale bit is hilarious!

7. Nerdy Prudes Must Die: Again, Will Branner is incredible, like holy mother of god. Killer title number. If I had one critique it‚Äôs that the titular phrase ‚ÄúNerdy Prudes Must Die‚Äù Is sung incredibly quickly to the point where it doesn‚Äôt roll off the tongue super well, but that‚Äôs an incredibly nit-picky songwriting critique that doesn‚Äôt really affect the overall experience. Poor Richie!

8. Hatchet Town: The song is great, obviously,  but OMG the cameos! A huge gift to Nightmare Time fans everywhere.

9. Just for Once: This isn‚Äôt Broadway but maybe just give Lauren Lopez a Tony anyway? Maybe she could step on me too? That‚Äôd be nice.

10. If I loved you: Absolute banger. It will be stuck in my head for months. I didn‚Äôt realize a sassy duet between Mariah and Joey was something I needed but now I don‚Äôt know how I‚Äôve lived this long without it.

11. The Summoning: I can‚Äôt imagine this hits quite as hard if you haven‚Äôt seen Nightmare Time, but as someone who has this was my favorite part of the show hands down. The Lords in Black are scene-stealers every time!

12. Cool as I think I Am (Reprise): My heart üò≠ But also props to Jeff Blim for masterfully mashing it up with If I Loved You. Combining multiple songs from different points in the show to highlight a character arc or theme is a nothing new in musical theatre but Jeff did it masterfully here!

13. The Best of You: It wouldn‚Äôt be a musical for teens without a Pop Punk parody. Absolute genius. And the choreography was fun! It‚Äôs a little jarring seeing Will onstage not playing Max after leaving such a strong impression as the character, but since this is effectively the finale number (soon to be subverted) of course he deserves to be up there with all the rest of them!

14. Dirty Dudes Must Die: It wouldn‚Äôt be a Hatchetfield story without a last-minute twist! This one is arguably the least surprising of the three stage musicals‚Äô endings, but it‚Äôs still a lot of fun, and Angela‚Äôs facial expressions are incredible! (Her acting is amazing throughout the whole show but it really shines through here). It‚Äôs a great send-off to a great show, and, though unfortunate, the pandemic- induced wait between Black Friday and this was absolutely worth it! 

Starkid continues to outdo themselves with every production, and I like everyone else can‚Äôt wait to see what they do next! Thanks for coming to my TED Talk.

UgzdR936v1PefsBgJZR4AaABAg,"I only discovered Team Starkids about a month and I'm already a HUGE fan of their work. The Guy Who Didn't Like Musicals and Black Friday are definitely in my Top 10 musicals. Edit: It has that goofy and wacky tone that I ABSOLUTELY love seeing, but still has the serious and dramatic moments to make me feel for the characters.
I just know that this will do the same thing that the other Hatchetfield musicals have done, but has it's own charm and style in order to make it stand-out and unique compared to others. Looking forward to seeing what happens in 'Nerdy Prudes Must Die' to see how the story goes, what familiar characters will appear (or mentioned) and what kind of catchy songs I'll be listening to all week.



(After I have seen the show & 102 Likes later) I FINALLY managed to watch the whole musical late on Tuesday 17th until after 1:30AM on Wednesday 18th October 2023 without avoiding as much spoilers as I could. I ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS MUSICAL! All of these songs are great, but my favourites have to be: 'If I Loved You', 'High School Is Killing Me' & 'Nerdy Prudes Must Die'; as well as 'The Summoning' and 'Bully/Bury the Bully'. I could go on about how great, each of the songs are for their own reasons and luckily lots of people seem to agree too. 
Each of the actors do a great job portraying brand-new characters and even reprising characters from previous Hatchetfield musicals (mainly Paul and Emma - great comeback scene btw). I do love these new characters for their own specific reasons mainly: Peter, Stephanie, Ruth, Grace, Ritchie; The Mayor and (of course) MAX. I really love the chemistry between Peter and Stephanie throughout the musical full of laugh, sincerity and even tears (THAT song made me cry), but their Love Ballad is definitely my favourite song on the whole musical (SOO CATCHY I've been hearing non-stop all week).
Can't wait until Team Starkids come back for a future installment in not just the Hatchetfield franchise, but any projects they have coming up. Hopefully we'll also see more of the new recruits - Will (Max) and Bryce (Detective Shapiro) appear in the future, since they were excellent in their specific roles. Keep up the INCREDIBLE job Starkids and I think I speak for all of us that we support and looking forward to seeing what you are planning next in the next few years.

Even though Lauren Lopez is an unquestioned fan-favorite among Starkid fans, with a ton of beloved performances where she has shown off her range, Ruth Fleming might actually be her best. Her line delivery is gut-bustingly funny, even if a line isn't as good as others she has in the show. And then, towards the beginning of the second act, she delivers a - forgive me - show-stopping number that is sad, utterly bizarre and reveals depth to Ruth that we don't see at any other point in the show. Oh, and Lauren Lopez sings the motherfucking hell out of it. Those cheers from the audience during the number didn't happen by accident. And then it ends with horrific irony: Ruth, the character desperate to be touched and noticed by someone, gets her longest sustained contact by another character when she is getting brutally murdered via a wedgie so forceful that it splits her in half. It's one of the few times that Ruth is on stage with only one other character, and it's the most solo attention she receives from another character. Ruth might low-key be the most tragic character in the entire show, yet also one of the funniest, and Lopez played every moment vibrantly.",111,@kellyrocheleau4660,False,False,False,0,Nerdy Prudes

I honestly think this might be the first Hatchetfield musical where I got really attached to the characters, and I think it's because there was a lot of character building before the paranormal stuff happened and we got a nice look into who the characters are.

What was the point of Mayor sending panic in city, by saying, that maybe your neighbors are Dangerous? Like, that not only was uncharacteristically stupid decision, but it also lead nowhere, which is surprising, since it in theory should've lead to more paranoia (like was shown in the ""Hatchet Town"", but throughout the plot). 

Just like in case of Show Stopping number, Just this once - is my favorite song in that musical. And, ironically, from plot perspective - I got problems with both songs. But if with show stopping number - I got a problem, because of the scene that it exists in (and professor going against his established characteristics), then with this song is like... Did we really needed to explore character of Rury, right before she died? Like that's cool and all - but she is still dead here. She didn't even became ""center of attention"" after she died, so why we are exploring it just now? Better never then late, I suppose.

That one is just a nitpick, but I think the joke ""I like being alive"", could've worked better, if Lipshitz was with Suicadal (misspell is on purpose) guy. Like, I get the Meta, that character is having fun being alive, right before he died, but I am sadly more of a ""character guy"", instead of a ""Meta guy"". I know why it would be kind of hard to write something like that, without accidentally being insensitive and god knows, it's the risk you're not going to take, and I partly respect that, but I still think the joke could've worked better if it worked in character, instead of in meta.

And Finally the Final Emotional scene between Steph and Pete wasn't earned (the one they have a dilemma of ""Shoot, or not shoot""): Why the hell Max let them Run, instead of killing them on spot? Just to tease them? Then why previous nerdy Prudes he didn't let Run, and instead beat them/Killed them? Even Lipshitz, before yelling him to ""Run"" (or in that case to go) he hit in the balls. So that Grace would have time to be corrupted by a Different god? So that Pete and Stephanie (who he blamed for everything, mind you), would have time to express feelings towards each other? Plus - if he is able to get them anywhere, then why he isn't doing it? After getting Shapiro unconscious, he could've easily killed them, while they were unconscious as well? Or at least trap them in a Car, as he did with Lipshitz. After Killing a Mayor, he still could've run and killed the Trio. Hell, let's pretend that all that I mentioned, was in character for him (you know, letting them Run, find a way to destroy him and get a time to do so). You wouldn't even needed to change the ending, since Grace could've come up with the plan of losing her Chastity on the spot where they were, but no, we needed dramatic moment between them, even when the Killer is on the way.",1,@AlinaAniretake,False,False,True,2,Nerdy Prudes

Jon as Wiggly again is just absolute perfection. His voice as Wiggly just makes me so unbelievably happy. I love all the different tones and sounds he makes as Wiggly (like the ahhhhhhh when he checks his Christmas list and the way he says Ste-phan-ie). I think this has to be one of Jon's best shows. His voice was really highlighted in a lot of the numbers and he killed it as both Richie and Wiggly. Joey is just always perfection. I love him as the nerdy Pete in this, his vocal talent just blows my mind. I love seeing how far he's come vocally from the AVPM days. I could listen to him sing all day. Mariah killed it as always, Lauren as horny Ruth had me dying, and Angela as Grace made me so happy, especially being a fan of Smosh as well.
